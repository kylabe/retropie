Setting up an "exit"-button (from [here](http://blog.petrockblock.com/forums/topic/dgen-over-composite-video/#post-1770) ):

I edit the dgenrc file in ```/RetroPie/configs/all/```:

```shell
# Quit DGen or switch to the next ROM on the command-line.
key_quit = escape
joy_quit = joystick0-button12
```
