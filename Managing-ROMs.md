RetroPie uses forks of the [MAME](http://mamedev.org/) and [FinalBurn Alpha](http://www.barryharris.me.uk/) emulators that work well on the Raspberry Pi hardware, but are based on older versions of the original code.  Your ROMs may be for earlier or later versions of MAME/FBA and if they are, they most likely will not work. 

The following chart is a quick reference for all the arcade emulators in RetroPie.

This is where [clrmamepro](http://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/) comes in.  Clrmamepro is a Windows utility for verifying and managing your ROMs. It can also run on Linux, using [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/). Clrmamepro is very powerful, but also somewhat complex and not friendly to new users. 

there is also a Mac version available now http://www.emulab.it its only in Beta at the moment, but it works exactly the same as the Windows utility 

Here are the steps to getting started with clrmamepro.

## Video Tutorial:
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_lssz2pAba8" target="_blank"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/_lssz2pAba8/mqdefault.webp" 
alt="clrmamepro Video" width="300" height="180" border="10" /></a>


##Requirements:#
* The current version of RetroPie. Romsets and packaged MAME/FBA emulators occasionally change.
* A Windows PC for setting up RetroPie and running clrmamepro. This tutorial assumes you are running a 64 bit version of Windows, but the steps for 32 bit Windows will be the same once you get past downloading the clrmamepro software.

**NOTE:** There are unsupported WINE versions available for OSX and Linux, if you Google.

## Step 1 - Back up your ROMs#
It is possible with clrmamepro to change one or two options and when it runs it will delete all your existing ROMs. OK, not really - using the default options it will make backups of any files it removes, but I have seen a lot of people when getting started mess up their ROMs beyond repair.

##Step 2 - Download [clrmamepro](http://mamedev.emulab.it/clrmamepro/#downloads)#
The version at the time of this article is 4.016.  I would recommend the 64 bit version if you are running a 64 bit OS, it will be significantly faster.  I would also recommend the zip version, just extract it to C:\clrmamepro.  There's no need to run the installer.

##Step 3 - Acquire DAT files#
DAT files are the [XML-based](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML) database definitions of the exact ROMs an emulator uses. Using the DAT files and [CRC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) checks, clrmamepro is able to identify which of your ROMs are valid for a given emulator.

You can download all .DAT files for all arcade emulators [**HERE**](https://github.com/HerbFargus/retropie-dat/archive/master.zip)
* For this tutorial, extract the zip file into `C:\` (but you can really put it anywhere you want)
* Open retropie-dat-master and you should see a list of folders. Each folder contains the .DAT files for the respective emulator. We will only be using `C:\retropie-dat-master\mame4all\MAME 0.37b5.dat` in this tutorial.
* Create a subdirectory `C:\retropie-dat-master\mame4allroms` (this will be used in the next step)
* Create a subdirectory `C:\retropie-dat-master\pifbaroms`

**NOTE:** Use the appropriate .DAT from the zip file if you want to target a different MAME/FBA emulator. The table at the top of this page details the files needed.

##Step 4 - Run clrmamepro for the first time#
* Run `C:\clrmamepro\cmpro64.exe`.  The welcome screen explains that common first steps are to 1) Create a Profile, 2) Set up your paths and 3) Scan your ROMs. We will be doing things slightly differently, in order to leave your source ROMs intact.  
* Click OK to the Welcome screen
* Click **"Add DatFile..."** and open the MAME4ALL DAT file at `C:\retropie-dat-master\mame4all\MAME 0.37b5.dat`
* Accept the default profile location of [PROFILES], click **"OK"**
* Select **"[NEW DATFILES]"** in the left-hand pane and select **"MAME 0.37b5"** in the right-hand pane
* Click **"Load / Update"**
* Clrmamepro will ask you how to generate the settings for this datfile, click **"Default"** (it is possible it will throw a warning but just select **"ok to all"** and continue on)
* You are now at the main window for clrmamepro.  We still need to set our paths, so click **"Settings"**
* Verify **"ROM-Paths"** is the selected option in the upper-left corner drop down menu
* Click the **"Add..."** button
* Select the folder you created in the last step called `C:\retropie-dat-master\mame4allroms` and click **"OK"**
* Close the settings window with the **"X"** button in the upper right

At this point, you could scan the ROMs folder you just selected, but we just created this folder and it is empty.  Instead, we will rebuild into this folder.  Clrmamepro can scan other locations for matching ROMs and build a new ROM set from them.

##Step 5- Rebuild a ROM set#
* In the main clrmamepro window, select **"Rebuilder"**
* The destination should already be filled in for you - it is the same as the ROM path you defined above in the settings window: `C:\retropie-dat-master\mame4allroms`
* Use the browse button **"..."** to select your source path.  For example you might have a full set of MAME v0.156 ROMs - point clrmamepro to that directory as your source.

* When rebuilding there are three options: **Merged Set, Split Set, and Non-Merged Set**. (**NOTE**: As a prerequisite you need a .dat file that contains merge data for the romset.  For best results build from a full romset.)

>To understand what these options mean, we must first understand the MAME concept of **parents** and **clones**:
>  - **Parent:** The main version of the game. This is _normally_ the most common variant, in the English language. They have all the files needed to play them within the .zip file.
>  - **Clone:** A variant of the Parent. Typically different language, or other small changes. Their .zips only contain the files that have been changed from the parent, meaning that the parent .zip must be present in the ROM directory for the clone to be ran.

  - **Merged Set:** puts _all_ files of the parents and clones of the game into a single .zip file. The version that will be launched will be the version that which is the .zip's name. To run a different version, rename the merged .zip to that of the version you want.
  - **Split Set:** parents are complete .zip files with everything needed, and clones are .zip files with _only_ their unique files, saving disk space. This means that you will have to transfer the appropriate parent .zip to your ROM directory for every clone .zip you wish to use. For example, pacman.zip (a clone), will not work without puckman.zip (its parent). This quickly gets confusing, so it's recommended to simply transfer the whole set to your ROM directory, to avoid missing file errors. **NOTE:** split sets are how most downloaded complete MAME romsets are presented.
  - **Non-Merged Set:** parents and clones in their own stand-alone .zip files. This removes clone's dependencies on parents, meaning you can take ANY of these .zip files (even the clones), put them in the appropriate ROM directory, and they should work! However, since every .zip has every required file, they will use higher total disk space. If you only want certain MAME ROMs on your system, use this method to ensure each .zip is usable stand-alone.

* Click **"Rebuild..."**.  Depending on the size of the directory you chose as a source, this could take some time
* When clrmamepro is finished rebuilding, you will see a window with statistics showing how many matching files were found, how many files were created and how many were skipped.  Click "OK" 
* Repeat for any other source paths you might have.  You can rebuild from multiple sources, but leave the Destination path the same
* When finished, close the Rebuilder with the **"X"** in the upper right corner of the window

Time to find out how well your source ROMs matched up...

##Step 6 - Scan a ROM set#
* In the main clrmamepro window, select **"Scanner"**
* Leave all settings at default and click **"New Scan..."**
* When clrmamepro finishes scanning, you will see a "Statistics" window with high level information and a "Scan Results" window with detailed information about your missing ROMs

##Repeat Steps 4 through 6 for the FBA ROM set#
* From clrmamepro "Profiler" window load the DAT file for PiFBA `C:\retropie-dat-master\pifba\fba_029671_od_release_10_working_roms.dat`
* From clrmamepro "Settings" windows set the ROM path to `C:\retropie-dat-master\pifbaroms`
* Use clrmamepro's "Rebuilder" to rebuild your existing ROMs to a new ROM set
* Scan the rebuilt ROMs using the "Scanner"

##Notes#

That's the basics of using clrmamepro.  Some additional notes:

* Be careful with the "Fix" settings in the Scanner window and the "Remove Matched Sourcefiles" setting in the Rebuilder window. These settings will remove and rename your ROMs.
* If clrmamepro does delete any ROMs (because you told it to), you should be able to find backups in C:\clrmamepro\backup as long as you didn't change the default settings.
* clrmamepro is very stable.  It has been around for a long time, it is regularly updated and it is widely used.  If it reports problems reading your ROMs, you most likely have corrupt ROM archives (zip files) or a failing hard drive.

* If you feel the need to reset clrmamepro's settings, just delete your existing profile(s) and reload your DAT file, selecting **"Default"** settings for the new profile.  Almost all of clrmamepro's settings are per-profile.

# List of Emulators and Their Respective Romsets:

RetroPie 3.0.0 MAME Versions

These details are as per the default installed binaries on the RetroPie 3.0.0 image.

**Important**

In 3.0.0 some emulators share directories, so you need to choose which FBA, NeoGeo and mame4all version you want.
So you can have 1 romset for each of these (mame4all, FBA, NeoGeo, advmame)
