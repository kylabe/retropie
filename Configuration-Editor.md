# Configuration Editor

The configuration editor allows a user to edit the configurations for RetroPie and Retroarch from a gui interface. Many common settings are set up so that a user can change the settings with a gamepad.

Manual configurations can also be set with the use of a keyboard (press tab to navigate out of the manual configs)

The Configuration Editor can be accessed from the RetroPie Menu or through the [RetroPie Setup Script](Updating-RetroPie) and navigate to **Setup / Configuration>> Edit RetroPie/RetroArch Configurations**

There are notes at the bottom of the screen that explain each setting and what they do.
