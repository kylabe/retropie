# Configuration Editor

The configuration editor allows a user to edit the configurations for RetroPie and Retroarch from a gui interface. Many common settings are set up so that a user can change the settings with a gamepad.

Manual configurations can also be set with the use of a keyboard (press tab to navigate out of the manual configs)

The Configuration Editor can be accessed from the RetroPie Menu or through the [RetroPie Setup Script](Updating-RetroPie) and navigate to **Setup / Configuration>> Edit RetroPie/RetroArch Configurations**

When changing settings, there are notes at the bottom of the screen that explain each setting and what they do.

When making manual edits you'll press `tab` on the keyboard to exit out of the edit session. Whatever edits you have made will be saved when you exit the dialog gui.
