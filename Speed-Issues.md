From [ToadKing](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=137827#p137827): 

BTW, for most of [those](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rm3IuXeIfaw) cores you should be able to get at or near full speed, with some exceptions:

* imame4all: Speed depends on the game. Certain Midway games are known for being really slow, like Mortal Kombat or NBA Jam.

* pocketsnes: Some games, especially SuperFX and SA-1 games, will be kinda slow on a stock speed Pi. Some graphic effects in other games can lag specific screens. I overclocked/overvolted my Pi to 950 Mhz and it runs most games at full speed, except for the SuperFX and SA-1 ones.

* vba-next: Will probably never be fullspeed on the Pi. An alternative port is being considered.

* genesis-plus-gx: Is still a bit too slow on the Pi. An alternative port is being considered.
