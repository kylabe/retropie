_The Sega Dreamcast is a 6th generation home video game console released by Sega in 1998. It is notably the last console that Sega produced._
***
## Emulator: [Reicast](https://github.com/reicast/reicast-emulator) (NOTE: EXPERIMENTAL!)

You'll download this from the experimental section of the setup script. it is very laggy and buggy. Pi 2 is highly recommended.

## ROMS

Accepted File Extensions: **.cdi** 

Place your Dreamcast ROMs in
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/dreamcast
```

## BIOS

The BIOS files needed are: **dc_boot.bin, dc_flash.bin**

Place your BIOS files in
```
/opt/retropie/emulators/reicast/data
```

## Controls

Currently controls are hard-coded to the source code so either your controller works or it doesn't. There isn't currently any keyboard support. 

Press ctrl+c to exit- that is the only way right now to quit the emulator.
