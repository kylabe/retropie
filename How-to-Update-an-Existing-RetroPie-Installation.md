I want to know if it’s possible to update RetroPie (the emulators, RetroArch itself and EmulationStation, etc) and if so, how do I do it?

Answer: In order to update the binaries that were installed by the script, you can select the option "UPDATE RetroPie Binaries" from the main menu of the RetroPie Setup Script. 
Alternatively, you could run the RetroPie Setup Script and use the “source-based installation” to re-compile and re-configure individual components. Depending on the selected components this could take some time, though.
