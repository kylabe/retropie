Using the raspi-config or rpi-update script, one can change the RAM splitting for the Raspberry Pi. Depending on your hardware setup you might have to change your splitting.

A Raspberry Pi B/B+/2 is highly recommended. The GPU should have at least 256MB RAM. If you have a Raspberry Pi A/A+  it is not possible to scrape games and use system themes.
