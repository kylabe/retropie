Using the raspi-config or rpi-update script, one can change the RAM splitting for the Raspberry. Depending on your hardware setup you might have to change your splitting. From [ToadKing](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=112241#p112241): If you're on 224/32, you can't run it (i.e., RetroArch) on a HD display. You'll have to use the 192/64 split at least.

A raspberry pi B/B+/2 is highly recommended. The gpu should have at least 256MB ram. If you have a raspberry pi A/A+  it is not possible to scrape games and use system themes.
