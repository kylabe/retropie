# Runcommand Menu

Each time you load a ROM there is an option to open what is called the runcommand menu. This is accessed by pressing any key on the keyboard or js0 (button 0 on your joypad- it will vary depending on the gamepad used)

It will open up into this menu (this menu may vary depending on the emulator you are running and version of retropie you are using- this image is for the super nintendo):

If you select the first option, if there is more than one emulator, you can swap which emulator is used:

There are also varying options to change video settings, RetroArch configs for that system, etc. 

In the past there were multiple rom folders for each emulator but they got confusing so now there is only one rom folder for each system and the emulator used can be loaded dynamically so there is no longer a need for multiple rom folders for each system.
