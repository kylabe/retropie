ROM Compatibility
-----------------

From [this thread](http://www.raspberrypi.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?p=219977#p219977):

You will get errors loading some mame roms. As RetroPie uses imame4all, not all roms are compatible or working.

You will need to download roms that are confirmed working with imame4all.

To find out which, have a look here...
