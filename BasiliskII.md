Make sure you have the latest version of the retropie-setup script and binaries/source build of basilisk.

Make sure you have the latest emulationstation config for it also by running

```
sudo ./retropie_packages basilisk configure
```

Place your mac rom at ~/RetroPie/roms/macintosh/mac.rom
Place a premade disk image at ~/RetroPie/roms/macintosh/disk.img

and it should load these on launch.

(Ctrl + Escape will exit the emulator)
