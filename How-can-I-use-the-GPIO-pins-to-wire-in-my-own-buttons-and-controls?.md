Hey all, I'm trying to create my own, portable, RetroPie system. I've got ES up and running with only one major hiccup to still iron over, which is any emulator will reset without warning, displaying "reset" in yellow letters, after about 20 minutes of play.

But the real situation I'm trying to figure out is how to wire the 16 buttons + joystick into the GPIO pins as a Virtual Keyboard input. I originally was going to use the MPR121 to do this, but it does not have enough inputs.  I think my best bet is to use the RetroPie GPIO adapter, but I'm kinda lost in how to pull it all together.  

Any help would be massively appreciated, and of course a whole album of my project will be up as soon as it is complete.
