## Music

To enable music in your Doom game(s) you need to copy MP3s with specific names into the same folder as your ROMs are located. You can find a list of names [here](https://github.com/libretro/libretro-prboom/blob/master/src/m_misc.c#L605): They follow the scheme e1m1.mp3, e1m2.mp3, ..., e2m1.mp, e2m2.mp3, ... . There are freely available tracks available - find them by searching for "PSX Doom Music".
