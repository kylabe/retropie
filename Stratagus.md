## ROMS
Stratagus runs games from properly configured game directories. For the Warcraft and Starcraft titles, run the appropriate extraction tools to extract the original data into a Stratagus game folder. You can get the extraction tools from https://github.com/Wargus/wargus for Warcraft 2, https://github.com/Wargus/war1gus for Warcraft 1, https://github.com/Wargus/stargus for Starcraft. Copy the extracted folder to the roms directory, adding a ".data" to the folder name.

Place your folders of game files in
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/stratagus
```

After you've added you files into the stratagus rom folder, the folder names appear in the selection UI and you can start them from there directly. All graphics settings are done in-game.
