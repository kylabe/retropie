Make sure you have the latest version of the retropie-setup script and binaries/source build of basilisk.

Make sure you have the latest emulationstation config for it also by running

```
sudo ./retropie_packages basilisk configure
```

Place your mac rom at ~/RetroPie/roms/macintosh/mac.rom (e.g. you can rename PERFORMA.ROM to mac.rom)
Place a premade disk image at ~/RetroPie/roms/macintosh/disk.img (e.g. You can rename MacStartup.img to disk.img)

and it should load these on launch.

(Ctrl + Escape will exit the emulator)

For more details see the forum post at http://blog.petrockblock.com/forums/topic/installing-basiliskii-an-early-macintosh-emulator/ and the links therein for detailed instructions about how to set up Basilisk II.
