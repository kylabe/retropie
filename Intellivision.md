_The Intellivision is a home video game console released by Mattel in 1979_

***
## Emulator: [jzintv](http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/)

## ROMS
Accepted File Extensions: **.int .bin**

Place your Intellivision ROMs in
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/intellivision
```
## BIOS
There are a few BIOS files for the Intellevision. The first two are the main ones you'll probably use.
* Executive ROM: **exec.bin**
* Graphics ROM: **grom.bin**
* Entertainment Computer System ROM: Commonly named ECS.BIN. Required to play ECS games. 
* Intellivoice ROM: Commonly named IVOICE.BIN. Required to play Intellivoice games. 

Place your BIOS files in:
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/BIOS
```
**You should only have to do these steps for older versions of RetroPie:**

According to [this post](http://blog.petrockblock.com/forums/topic/intellivision-emulation/#post-2208):

I put my exec.bin and grom.bin in:
```shell
/usr/local/share/jzintv/rom
```
This is one of the two paths that the emulator is set to look in. The jzintv and subfolder rom did not exist so I had to create them..
```shell
cd /usr/local/share
sudo mkdir jzintv
sudo mkdir jzintv/rom
```
and then I moved the exec.bin and gbrom.bin file from my intellivision rom directory:
```shell
sudo mv ~/RetroPie/roms/intellivision/* /usr/local/share/jzintv/rom
```

Then I was able to launch my intellivision romsâ€¦ hope this helps!
