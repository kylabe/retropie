Sound still is a problem child with the Raspberry Pi. Currently, there does not seem to be a best solution for all the sound issues.

This place re-cites some posts (or parts of them) from different forum threads that might increase the sound quality:

* Update the retroarch.cfg file with audio_out_rate = 44100
Using that config the ALSA sound coming from the headphone jack is a lot clearer and has a lot less static.
