Sound still is a problem child with the Raspberry Pi. Currently, there does not seem to be a best solution for all the sound issues.

This place re-cites some posts (or parts of them) from different forum threads that might increase the sound quality:

* Update the retroarch.cfg file with audio_out_rate = 44100
Using that config the ALSA sound coming from the headphone jack is a lot clearer and has a lot less static.

## Users Configurations

You can post your configuration here to give other people an idea about what kind of audio they can expect with certain settings. Interesting parameters might be 
* HDMI/analog
* ARM frequency
* emulator core
* eventually parameters set in /etc/retroarch.cfg
* perceived audio quality, problems
