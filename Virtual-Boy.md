***
_The Virtual Boy was Nintendo's attempt at virtual reality in 1995 and it was a horrid commercial failure._

***
## Emulator: [lr-beetle-vb](https://github.com/libretro/beetle-vb-libretro) (Experimental)
This Emulator is currently experimental and will need to be installed from the experimental section of the setup script.  On testing it seems to work fine.

## ROMS
Accepted File Extension: **.vb**

Place your Virtual Boy ROMs in 
```
/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/virtualboy
```

## Controls

lr-beetle-vb utilises Retroarch configurations

Add custom retroarch controls to the retroarch.cfg file in
```shell
/opt/retropie/configs/virtualboy/retroarch.cfg
```
For more information on custom RetroArch controls see: [RetroArch Configuration](https://github.com/petrockblog/RetroPie-Setup/wiki/RetroArch-Configuration)
