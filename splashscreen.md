- **Choose RetroPie Splashscreen:** This option allows you to choose a splashscreen that has been installed on RetroPie by default. See the gallery of images [**HERE**](https://github.com/RetroPie/retropie-splashscreens/wiki)
- **Choose Own Splashscreen:** Once you've opened up the splashscreen menu in the setup script at least once a folder will be created in `/home/pi/RetroPie/splashscreens` you can also access this splashscreens folder from samba shares once its created. You can create a new folder in `splashscreens` and place your splashscreen (image or video) in it.
