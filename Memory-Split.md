### Memory Split

Since the raspberry pi is a SoC the CPU and GPU share the same amount of RAM. The following option allows you to choose how much RAM you allocate to the GPU compared to the CPU.

Earlier versions of RetroPie included a default EmulationStation theme with large image files, that would eventually cause a 'white screen' when too many systems were active. Now the default theme ('Carbon') is much lighter so there is no reason to change the split unless you choose a heavier theme. Emulation itself uses very little video memory.

You can choose a split from 16/32/64/128/256 (the settings may be different depending on the version of pi you have)
