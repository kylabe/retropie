### Memory Split

Since the raspberry pi is a SoC the CPU and GPU share the same amount of RAM. The following option allows you to choose how much RAM you allocate to the GPU compared to the CPU. This will typically resolve emulationstation being laggy/ freezing with too many systems as well as kodi freezing, among other things.

You can choose a split from 16/32/64/128/256 (the settings may be different depending on the version of pi you have)
